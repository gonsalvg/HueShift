# HueShift

-Takes all images from folder titled `wallpapers` in same directory and generates 6 hue shifted images to directory `output` based on the original. 

-Useful for color changing wallpapers and smoothly color shifting backgrounds such as OBS image tool

*images must be JPG or PNG*

This is just a small exploratory project
I edit photos quite a bit- this mostly came about from wanting to automate the process.
